# TabTex: A Google Chrome Extension
TabTex aims to be the most frictionless referencing/url-preserving tool in the browser extensions space! Because you need to remember that useful URL which you visited last week!

Effortlessly export the title and URL of your open tabs as text.
[Check it out in the Chrome Webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tabtex-your-tabs-in-text/biegdeiiiaifgdaibelghkalfhdpifnm).

TabTex is designed to make saving, documenting, and referencing your tabs fast, simple, and efficient. ðŸš€
