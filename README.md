# TabTex: A Google Chrome Extension
TabTex aims to be the most frictionless referencing/url-preserving tool in the browser extensions space! Because you need to remember that useful URL which you visited last week!

Let's you use the CTRL+X or CMD+X to cut and paste across! 
I personally love this as it helps to modify some of the titles to make more sense next time I refer to them!

Effortlessly export the title and URL of your open tabs as text.
[Check it out in the Chrome Webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tabtex-your-tabs-in-text/biegdeiiiaifgdaibelghkalfhdpifnm).

## Features

Get the URLs and Titles for the Tab Group currently in focus:

It is possible to cut/change/copy as you wish before copying over the selection leaving the user with freedom to make the information more relevant for the specific use-case.
