## Release history
#### v 1.1: Some feedback incorporated, (In-progress)
1) Rename the radio buttons so that they are more easier to understand (and takes less realestate on the pop-up)
2) Clean up the icon background (make it transparent)
3) Make it easier to update the extension (developer idea!) - made the TabTex text clickable, linked to the extension website
4) Save the user's last use export choice 
NOTE: Since this state is saved in browser itself, upon browser cache cleaning or browser application storage cleaning this will be removed.

2) All tabs in this window (All the open tabs in the current window)
3) All tabs in all windows (All tabs across all the Chrome windows)
4) All active tabs across windows (All active tabs meaning the one that's visible at first across all the tabs in Chrome)
